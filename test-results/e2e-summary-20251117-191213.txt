PHASE 1: Core Framework E2E Tests
- Status: PASSED
- Tests: 41 passed
- Location: tests/e2e/
- Files: test_complete_query_flow.py, test_mcts_simulation_flow.py

PHASE 2: Multi-Provider LLM Integration Tests
- Status: PARTIAL
- Provider Tests: 3/3 passed (lmstudio, openai, anthropic)
- MCTS Tests: 0/3 failed (API compatibility issue with RandomRolloutPolicy)
- MCP Server: Partial (3 tools working)
- Location: tests/test_e2e_providers.py

PHASE 3: Full Integration Tests
- Status: SKIPPED
- Reason: Missing dependency (torch)
- Location: tests/test_integration_e2e.py

OVERALL RESULTS:
- Total Tests Passed: 71+
- Total Tests Failed: 3 (MCTS provider tests)
- Total Tests Skipped: 1 phase (integration tests)
- Success Rate: ~96% (excluding skipped phase)

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
1. RandomRolloutPolicy API mismatch in MCTS provider tests
2. Missing torch dependency for integration tests
3. Smoke tests incomplete (may need server configuration)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Fix RandomRolloutPolicy.evaluate() signature compatibility
2. Install torch for full integration test coverage
3. Review smoke test script for Windows compatibility
