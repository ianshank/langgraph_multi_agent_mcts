"""
Assembly Theory integration for LangGraph Multi-Agent MCTS Framework.

This module implements Assembly Theory concepts for quantifying complexity
and guiding agent decisions based on construction pathways and reusability.

Key Components:
- AssemblyIndexCalculator: Core complexity measurement
- ConceptExtractor: Extract concepts and build dependency graphs
- AssemblyGraph: Specialized graph structure for assembly pathways
- SubstructureLibrary: Pattern reuse tracking
- AssemblyFeatureExtractor: Feature extraction for ML models

Based on:
Assembly Theory by Cronin, Walker, et al.

Note: This module requires networkx for graph operations.
If networkx is not installed, imports will fail gracefully.
