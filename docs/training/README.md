## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Setup Issues:**
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `LANGSMITH_API_KEY not set`: Configure environment variables
- `OpenAI API rate limit`: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff

**Tracing Issues:**
- Traces not appearing: Check `LANGSMITH_TRACING_ENABLED=true`
- Incorrect hierarchy: Review context propagation in async code

**Agent Issues:**
- HRM too generic: Improve prompt specificity, add few-shot examples
- TRM not converging: Adjust convergence threshold or max iterations
- MCTS suboptimal: Increase iterations, tune exploration constant

**Performance Issues:**
- High latency: Profile to find bottleneck, cache results, reduce iterations
- Flaky tests: Use mocks for LLM calls, fix race conditions
