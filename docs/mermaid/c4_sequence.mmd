  App->>MC: features (state) or text (BERT)
  MC->>LLM: (optional) prompt for feature extraction/aux
  LLM-->>MC: completion
  MC-->>App: MetaControllerPrediction(agent, confidence, probs)

  App->>PC: upsert 10D vector + metadata (agent, probs, len, iter)
  App->>BT: log hyperparams/epoch or prediction
  Note over PC,BT: buffering when not configured
