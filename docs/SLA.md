## LangGraph Multi-Agent MCTS Framework

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Effective Date**: 2025-01-01
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15

---

## 1. Service Overview

The LangGraph Multi-Agent MCTS Framework provides intelligent multi-agent reasoning with Monte Carlo Tree Search tactical simulation. This SLA defines the performance commitments and operational standards for the production service.

---

## 2. Availability Commitment

### 2.1 Uptime Guarantee

| Tier | Uptime Target | Max Downtime/Year | Max Downtime/Month |
|------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Standard** | 99.5% | 43.8 hours | 3.65 hours |
| **Production** | 99.9% | 8.76 hours | 43.8 minutes |
| **Enterprise** | 99.95% | 4.38 hours | 21.9 minutes |

**Measurement**: Availability = (Total Minutes - Downtime Minutes) / Total Minutes × 100

### 2.2 Scheduled Maintenance

- **Maintenance Window**: Sundays 02:00-06:00 UTC
- **Advance Notice**: 72 hours minimum
- **Emergency Patches**: 24 hours notice (security-critical only)
- **Maintenance Impact**: Not counted against uptime SLA if announced

### 2.3 Excluded Downtime

The following are **not** counted against uptime commitments:
- Scheduled maintenance windows
- Customer-caused outages (invalid API keys, rate limit violations)
- Force majeure events (natural disasters, major infrastructure failures)
- Third-party service outages (LLM providers, cloud infrastructure)

## 3. Performance Objectives

### 3.1 Latency Targets

| Metric | Standard Tier | Production Tier | Enterprise Tier |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **P50 Latency** | < 10 seconds | < 5 seconds | < 3 seconds |
| **P95 Latency** | < 30 seconds | < 15 seconds | < 10 seconds |
| **P99 Latency** | < 60 seconds | < 30 seconds | < 20 seconds |
| **Max Latency** | < 120 seconds | < 60 seconds | < 45 seconds |

**Notes**:
- Latency measured from request receipt to response sent
- MCTS-enabled queries may have higher latency (scales with iterations)
- RAG retrieval adds 1-3 seconds to baseline

### 3.2 Throughput Guarantees

| Tier | Requests/Minute | Requests/Hour | Burst Capacity |
|------|----------------|---------------|----------------|

| **Enterprise** | 1,000 | 50,000 | 2,000/second |

### 3.3 Error Rate Limits

| Error Type | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Total Error Rate** | < 0.1% | > 1% |
| **Server Errors (5xx)** | < 0.05% | > 0.5% |
| **Timeout Errors** | < 0.1% | > 1% |

### 4.3 RAG Retrieval Quality
